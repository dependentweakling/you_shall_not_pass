Offline Password Manager

This program creates a command line program to manage passwords accessibly and securely. The command takes in a website or service for which the user has stored a password, and, upon receiving the correct password, will copy the password directly to the user's clipboard. This allows for long and complex passwords to easily be copied without accidentally also copying extra spacers and such. 

The screen is cleared for the event that someone is watching the screen physically or remotely. The purpose of this program is to eliminate the need for browser or other online password managers, which may compromise your data in the event that the one browser's database is hacked. Furthermore, it replaces other documents or sticky notes that may be deleted by accident by it's direct accessibility only through an IDE.

Further down the line, I would like to look into my own encryption methods.
